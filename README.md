# Branching-Consiousness
This paper proposes a mathematical model for the Branching Repository Reality Theory
(BRRT), which describes consciousness as a wave function interacting with reality through quantum
superposition and collapse. We present an equation modeling reality selection as a probability
function and explore experimental methods for testing this theory. We discuss links to existing
theories such as quantum mechanics, the Many-Worlds Interpretation, and consciousness studies,
outlining a framework for future empirical validation
